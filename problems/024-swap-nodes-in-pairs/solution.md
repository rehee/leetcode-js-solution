#24. Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

the problem require swap every 2 node. i just curious that if the node list is odd, how about the last one.

what i do for this solutin, is put the link list to another list, then check the list is odd or not. if is odd, then loop to the max length -1. loop step is 2. then i can swap the node.

the first verion for now is looks ok.
