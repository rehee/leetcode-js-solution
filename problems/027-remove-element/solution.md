#27. Remove Element (easy)
Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

same on the tain XD

very easy again and same with problem 26

i thought they will get same problem with 26 so i just loop and splice the item.
