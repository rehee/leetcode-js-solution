#36. Valid Sudoku (medium)
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

the level is medium but i think it's easy.

check each row, check each column check each 3x3 cell. if any one is not valid, the suodku is not valid
